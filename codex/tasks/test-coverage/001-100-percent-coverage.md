# Task: Achieve 100% test coverage

## Goal
Reach full statement, branch, and function coverage across the project.

## Steps
1. Run coverage reports to locate gaps.
2. Write tests for uncovered code paths.
3. Set coverage thresholds to `100` in `vitest.config.ts`.
4. Add coverage enforcement to CI workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Coverage reports show 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
- CI fails if coverage falls below 100%.
- README or docs note the 100% coverage guarantee.
