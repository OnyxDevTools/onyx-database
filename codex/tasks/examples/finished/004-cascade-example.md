# Task: Example for cascade

Create an example demonstrating the use of `cascade` to include related records.

## Plan
1. Add `examples/query/cascade.ts` showing `.cascade('relation')` on a query builder.
2. Use sample tables with a defined relationship to demonstrate cascading.
3. Output parent and related records to confirm loading behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] An example under `examples/` shows chaining `cascade` to load relationships.
